I learnt implementing animations using both ScrollMagic and Timeline. 
Chaining multiple animations using timeline.
use of to and fromTo undertimeline 
use of triggers (triggerElemenet and triggerHook) where trigger Element specifies which css class element to perform the animation and triggerHook which specifiies where and at what point in that css class element should the animation occur.
